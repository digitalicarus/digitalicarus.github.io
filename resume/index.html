							<h2>Staff Software Engineer</h2>
							<strong>ESO Solutions</strong>
							<aside> September 2013 - Present</aside>
						</header>
 
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Analytics</h3>
							<p>
								An analytics app for viewing EMS data from an OLAP database.
								Used AngularJS and HighCharts to display line and bar graphs as well as drill
								through reports.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>Patient Outcomes</h3>
							<p>
								An AngularJS app for displaying HL7 outcome information recieved from a hospital and
								linking it to EMS records in order to get a more complete picture of the continuum of care.
								<br/>
								This includes a view tracking system to remember which EMS providers had viewed each 
								outcome.
								<br/>
								The report viewer is a split view that renders the outcome information and the PCR side-by-side
								using Mozilla's PDFJS.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>EHR</h3>
							<p>
								EHR is the flagship application of the company. 
								It is used to document EMS patient encounters in the field.
								This fifth revision is the first JavaScript version of the product.
								It uses AngularJS and has a host of complex custom controls and input formats such
								as:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Several modal types - shelf, dialog, (Texas) toaster dialogs for branching input contexts.</li>
								<li>A 3D anatomical family of models that can be intertially rotated with RXJS and marked with injuries and ailments.</li>
								<li>A JavaScript based injection rules system. Clicking an error asynchonously navigates to any field on any screen and activates it.</li>
								<li>Searchable single and multi select panels.</li>
								<li>A vitals capturing system with animated face pain scale.</li>
								<li>A quick-entry treatment, assessment, and alert system with dynamically generated lightning effect using a 2 dimensional midpoint displacement algorithm.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								This would later become the seed for the ESO Angular Core controls project.<br/>
								I wrote a majority of the front-end including the 3D anatomical family, vitals capture, lightning effect, and many of the custom controls.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Admin</h3>
							<p>
								This is an administrative console for self-service management of all the application at the company.
								It was completely rewritten using a site-map strategy with a fuzzy search index. This application
								uses the core component framework, ESO Angular Core, developed in AngularJS.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Fire Incidents</h3>
							<p>
								Next to EHR, this is the second most complex front-end application in the company. The most interesting
								aspect of this app is dynamic validation on every front-end value change. The number of rules potentially
								run on a keystroke can be hundreds and a full validation set in the thousands. All the rules are run 
								using an injection technique for the data, each being a pure function. The rules are run in a web worker
								so that there is no performance effect on the UI thread while the user interacts with the application.
								This application was the first to use the AngularJS core component framework, ESO Angular Core, distilled from EHR.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Fire Inspections</h3>
							<p>
								Used for fire inspections of any kind of property such as a restaurant, apartment complex, etc.
								The most interesting aspect of this application was a massive set of fire codes downloaded to the front-end
								and indexed for fuzzy searching within a trie data structure. This application uses AngularJS and ESO Angular Core.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Activities</h3>
							<p>
								This application is a way for fire and EMS organizations to document community events and 
								operational activities at their stations. It uses Angular 10 and the associated ESO Core framework.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Login and Identity Service</h3>
							<p>
								This is a complete rewrite of the Log In experience to accomodate SSO and two factor authentication.
								I wrote all the front-end and web flows. It uses Angular 10 and ESO Core.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Patient Tracker</h3>
							<p>
								This application is used at the hospital to see incoming EMS patients. It is also used from the hospital 
								perspective to associate patient outcomes at the hospital with ePCR records.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Angular Core</h3>
							<p>
								This is a complete custom component framework for ESO applications written using AngularJS. Components include
								text, number, and date inputs and calendar pickers with custom validation, many modal types, masked inputs,
								single and multi-select components with search indexing, a signature input component using RXJS, and many others..
								<br/>
								I also wrote a documentation generator using the same generation framework as the AngularJS project, dgeni.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>ESO Core</h3>
							<p>
								ESO Core is a port and evolution of the ESO Angular Core framework but using Angular 10+ and very idiomatic
								Angular. Any web developer familiar with Angular can use Core quite easily as it implements Control Value Accessor
								and other appropriate interfaces for input control types.

							<h2>Senior Front-end Engineer</h2>
							<strong>PayPal</strong>
							<aside> April 2010 - September 2013</aside>
						</header>

						<div class="project">
							<h3>Internal Developer API Portal</h3>
							<p>
								This portal was a way to aggregate the many sources of internal API documentation at the company.
								A database aggregated many forms of API documentation into an abstract form and a Node 
								backend generated a unified view of all of the documents as well as links back to original
								resources.
							</p>
						</div>  
						<div class="project">
							<h3>3rd Party JS Suite</h3>
							<p>
								This was a POC that I created for the purpose of making 3rd party applications at PayPal
								easy to create, deploy, and test. It integrated EasyXDM for more advanced cross domain
								communication on a 3rd party merchant site through several early pre-CORS cross domain
								techniques.
							</p>
						</div> 
						<div class="project">
							<h3>PayPal Identity - Log In with PayPal</h3>
							<p>
								The PayPal Identity project was a system to provide not only PayPal log in to 3rd parties, 
								but also a risk system that could identify fraud. The original notion of this is to 
								bring a verified financial element to federated identity. Merchants using PayPal as an
								identity provider would know that authenticated users weren't fraudulent and had valid
								financial instruments protected by PayPal in order to shop.
							</p>
							<p>
								I did the user interfaces for the log in and verification web flows, the
								cross domain JavaScript code for integration on the 3rd party site, and created 
								training material and demos of developer APIs and implementation of the product.
							</p>
						</div> 
						<div class="project">
							<h3>Adaptive Payments</h3>
							<p>
								Adaptive Payment is a PayPal payments platform that enables a consumer to craft
								many complex payment scenarios such as parallel and chained payments through an API.
								It allows merchants and contractors to split payments to be fulfilled
								in parallel with configurable amounts for each recipient. It also supports chained 
								payments for scenarios like subcontracting. 
							</p>
							<p>
								My job was to supply the web flows and email content which explained and guided end-users through
								these more complex payment flow processes. Progressive enhancement was used so that all web flows
								worked without JavaScript but were enhanced with it. All web flows were fully localized including
								right-to-left support for support in Israel.
							</p>
							<p>
								Developed JavaScript bookmarklets for development and testing in 3rd party JS scenarios and wrote
								a suite of Bash scripts to navigate a complex development environment topology.

							<h2>Manageability Firmware Developer</h2>
							<strong>HP</strong>
							<aside>August 2007 - March 2010</aside>
						</header>
 
						<div class="project">
							<h3>Superdome 2 Onboard Administrator</h3>
							<p>
								Created a before-its-time web application for system management on the HP Integrity Superdome 2. 
								The Superdome 2 is a high-end cellular blade system with configurable electrically isolated partitioning.
								This machine was completely new and the interface was developed alongside the hardware and firmware.
								A small single-board computer manages the entire system of up to two cabinets with 16 blades.
								The computer is an embedded linux computer built around a PowerPC system on chip.
								This computer and the web application is known commercially as the Onboard Administrator (OA).
							</p>
							<p>
								Much of the mid-tier portions of this project were outsourced.
								I organized the work and was effectively the project manager for the entirety of the web management interface.
							</p>
							<p>
								The development environment was Linux x86 where C and C++ code was cross compiled to PowerPC. 
								The web interface consisted of HTML, JavaScript, XML, XSLT, and CSS. 
								This predates the use of MVC web frameworks and supported browsers back to IE6.
								The web client uses XHR and communicates with a C-based gSOAP binary through CGI.
								This C binary communicates with various system management firmware Linux applications to retrieve 
								health statuses, general information, cooling status, thermal data, and configuration data for 
								all of the components.
							</p>
							<p>
								This SOAP binary also provides the interface with commands used to change system settings and configuration.
							</p>
							<p>
								I developed a mock application in C for the SOAP interface that also managed client user sessions.
								The mock application allowed the web UI to be developed ahead of all of the system monitoring and configuration firmware application.
								This application used a Perl SOAP deserializer called Expat to manipulate data into interesting XML responses used to unit test and debug the "DHTML" web client. 
								I devised an embedded test application within the product itself which intercepted polled system events (XHR long polling).
								It presented an editor in the browser where the XML could be modified before resuming the subscribed code that consumed responses.
							</p>
							<p>
								Surprisingly, this product was not assigned a designer.
								I created the photographic representations of all the server components complete with 
								dynamic device presence and health indicators (images of devices, blinking LEDs, status icons, etc).
								The visualization represented exactly what a technician would see when they approached the machine
								in the datacenter.

							<h3>Superdome 2 Management Firmware Test Infrastructure</h3>
							<p>
								Used Perl and MySQL to design, implement, and maintain a test infrastructure which supported other test developers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Designed and implemented a MySQL schema for test log storage and result analytics web applications. 
								Database design was optomized to 4th normal form using knowledge and techniques from Database in Depth by CJ Date. 
								Date was a protegÃ© of the father of the relational model, EF Codd. 
								Database was tuned using diagnostic tools and techniques like MyTop, query cache monitoring, and cache sizing modifications.
							</p>
							<p>
								Test results, metrics displays, and triage data were presented and edited from small web applications. 
								These smal web applications were also built using Perl, MySQL, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
